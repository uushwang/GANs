# GANs
The project aims to implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images that resemble paintings. GANs are a class of deep learning models that involve two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The Generator tries to create fake images that look real, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images.
